<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>Welcome to <em>Bug Killer</em>, a web game designed to help computer science students learn debugging techniques. 
This page provides an introduction to the game and some basic useful information.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>In <em>Bug Killer</em> you play as a computer science student, working as an intern for <em>Denseware</em>,
the world's worst software company. Your goal is to survive until the end of summer, when you can return to school.</p>

<h2>How to Register</h2>
<p><em>Bug Killer</em> uses Google Accounts to handle registration and logins. If you do not have a Google account,
	you can <a href="https://www.google.com/accounts/NewAccount">create one now.</a> After you have created a Google
	account and used it to sign in, you must register for <em>Bug Killer</em> separately. This is a quick and simple
	process. All this does is add you to our database so we can record your progress in the game.</p>

<h2>How to Play</h2>
<p>The gameplay consists of a series of levels (Accessed throughout the <a href="problems">Available Problems</a> page), each of which contains
 a programming problem. In each problem, you are given a buggy C++ program, and an explanation of what it should do. 
 Your job, as an intern at Denseware, is to fix the buggy program. If you have trouble solving a problem, you can seek
 help from other players, and each problem also has hints which can help you solve it.</p>

<h2>Teams</h2>
<p>You are not alone in your quest to fix buggy code, however. Through the <a href="viewteams">Join a Different Team</a> page, you can join
a team of other players. On the <a href="highscores">Team Rankings</a> page, you can see how well your team is performing compared
to the other teams, and how well you're performing compared to the rest of your team. Also, because <em>Bug Killer</em>
uses email addresses as user names, the team statistics page makes it easy to contact other players on your team
when you need help with a problem.</p>
